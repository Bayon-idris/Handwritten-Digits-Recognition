A professional implementation of handwritten digit recognition using Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) from scratch and with TensorFlow/Keras.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a neural network that can recognize handwritten digits (0-9) using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system includes image preprocessing, neural network training, and real-time prediction capabilities.

## 📊 Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Binarization, cropping, resizing (16x16), noise removal
- **Neural Network**: Custom BP neural network implementation
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves over 95% recognition rate
- **Real-time Prediction**: Test with your own handwritten digits
- **Professional Pipeline**: End-to-end ML workflow

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bayon-idris/Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
